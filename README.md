First, we examined the distribution using histograms and Q-Q plots, which suggested that the data follows an exponential distribution. For an exponential distribution:

UMVU (Uniform Minimum Variance Unbiased) Estimator:
For exponential distribution, UMVU estimator is λ̂ = (n-1)/(n*x̄)
MME (Method of Moments Estimator):
For exponential distribution, MME estimator is λ̂ = 1/x̄

Using 'a' as the mean of the data, here's our analysis:
