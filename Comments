Interpretation of Results:

Estimator Comparison:

Both UMVU and MME estimators yielded very similar values, which is expected given our large sample size.
The small differences between the estimators are due to sampling variance.


Probability Analysis:
For both estimators:

P(X > a) is approximately 0.368 (≈ 1/e)
P(X < a) is approximately 0.632 (≈ 1-1/e)


Theoretical Alignment:

These results align perfectly with theoretical expectations for an exponential distribution
When using the mean value (a), we expect:

P(X > μ) = 1/e ≈ 0.368
P(X < μ) = 1-1/e ≈ 0.632




Empirical Validation:

The empirical probabilities closely match the theoretical values
This strong alignment confirms that our data follows an exponential distribution
The close match between empirical and theoretical probabilities validates our choice of distribution


Overall Assessment:

The analysis confirms that our data follows an exponential distribution
Both UMVU and MME estimators perform well for this dataset
The consistency between theoretical and empirical probabilities suggests our model is a good fit
The large sample size contributes to the reliability of our estimates



This comprehensive analysis demonstrates that both UMVU and MME estimators are effective for this dataset, with results that closely align with theoretical expectations for an exponential distribution. 
The minimal differences between the two estimation methods suggest that either approach would be suitable for practical applications with this dataset.
